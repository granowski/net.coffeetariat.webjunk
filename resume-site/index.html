    <h2>A load of ... casual discussion points!</h2>
    <p>I've spent a lot of time teaching myself in my youth. I've had SUN SPARC workstations. Embedded MIPS/ARM SoCs. I have built at least 4 desktops with various 'features'.</p>
    <p>A desktop build entirely from TEMU/Alibaba bought components, I've installed and use FreeBSD and configured multiple disks to be RAID 1 configured for redundancy.</p>
    <p>I've set up my own samba server configurations so I can host my RAID storage internal to my home storage.</p>
    <p>NetBSD has a special place in the heart... love me some Toaster OS's.</p>
    <p>I harbor significant interest in ARM devices as they are replacing Intel based systems. I have a libre computer le Potato, a CuBox i4 Pro, a Pine64 ROCKPro64 and Pine Book Pro, as well as a couple Raspberry Pi Zero's (a Wireless model 1 and 2).</p>
    <p>A long time ago, I ran a netbook for a solid 2 years straight with never powering it off because I kicked off a generator program that would calculate a cryptographic key for the TOR service. I wanted to create an onion route with 9 characters. "swingbait...".onion.
    A "swingbait" is a colloquel term that is used to indicate a dancer (usually in a swing scene) is a treat to dance with. I had goals to create a dancer registry at one point.</p>
    <p>I learned how to setup TOR hidden services so I could host websites on the internet without needing to register a domain name with ICANN. I have yet to actively host any back-end services yet, but the day is a comin'.</p>
    <p>I spent about 8 years dancing and learning various Jazz-oriented dances like Lindy Hop, Blues, Collegiate Shag, St. Louis Shag, and Balboa. Initially I started in a ballroom, but was like "where do I learn the Charleston!?" Denver will always be my first home away from my family-home.</p>
    <p>Give myself a lot of poop, because out of college, I had such wonderful ideas like "running C# on Linux", and "building a coffee ordering app". It's like the future was telling me to get on it, and I missed the opportunity to create Xamarin and/or the Starbuck's mobile ordering app.</p>
    <p>I grew up mostly unsupervised on the net, and have lived days when the internet was more free, but when you could also see never unseeable content. It's a shame the internet is dead! (Dead internet theory is real.)</p>
    <p>A cactus that has survived 3 apocalypses is still alive and well in my apartment window.</p>
